# rpi-lamp-stack

Turn your Raspberry Pi into a LAMP web server that starts on boot.

This has been tested on both ARM64 Mac and AMD64 Mac laptops.

AMD is much slower as expected due to emulation.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jonnymacs/rpi-lamp-stack
cd rpi-lamp-stack
./build.sh
```

Use the Raspberry Pi Imager tool to install the img file located in deploy
on an SD card or USB stick.
